1. Create an immutable java class Complex that represents a complex number with
integer real and imaginary components. It should have the following
functionalities:
a. Adding two complex numbers
b. Subtracting two complex numbers
c. Absolute value of complex number
d. Conjugate of complex number
e. Multiply two complex numbers
f. Display the complex number as “a + bi”
2. Create a new class similar to the above in terms of functionalities but which
supports the use of arbitrary types (int, float, double) to store the real and
imaginary components.
[Hint: Can be done by using object type and casting explicitly]
3. Create another class similar to (2) using generics.
4. Write a demo class called ComplexDemo to demonstrate the use of Complex
classes created in (1), (2) and (3). This class should instantiate Complex class
objects, call the functions mentioned in part (1) and print out the results.
